You can use base Python to perform basic visualizations with a dataset. Let's take a look at a few examples.

Letâ€™s re-load in our Gapminder data:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstaf/gapminder/master/gapminder/gapminder.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

```{python, fig.show='hide'}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.scatter(x = df['year'], y = df['pop'])
```

```{python}
df_AF = df[df['continent'] == 'Africa']
df_AF.head()
```
```{python, fig.show='hide'}
plt.scatter(x = df_AF['year'], y = df_AF['pop'])
```

Base Python works well for simple visualizations, but Altair is a package that helps to create personalized and detailed visualizations to suit any task. See the article titled 'Visualizing with Altair in Python' to learn more about it.
