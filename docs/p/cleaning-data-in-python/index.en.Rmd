```

Recall the URL with the country data. Let's use this to practice some preliminary cleaning techniques.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jstaf/gapminder/master/gapminder/gapminder.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

If we wanted to check and see if there are any empty values in the data frame, we could do so like this:

```{python}
df.isnull().sum().sum()
```

Above, we summed over all rows and columns to see if there were null values. if we wanted to check for null values in just one column, we could do so like this:

```{python}
df['country'].isnull().sum()
```

## Renaming Columns

If we wanted to look at changing the names of the columns in the data frame, whether it is because of formatting or lack of clarity in the existing titles, we can do so easily.

Let’s say we wanted to change `country` to `Country`. In order for the changes to save, we have to update our stored variable by starting the code with `df = ....`

```{python}
df = df.rename({'country': 'Country'}, axis = 1)
df.head()
```

Now let’s say we want to change `lifeExp` to `Life_Expectancy`, `pop` to `Population` and `gdpPercap` to `GDP_per_Cap`.

```{python}
df = df.rename({'lifeExp': 'Life_Expectancy',
                'pop': 'Population',
                'gdpPercap': 'GDP_per_Cap'}, axis = 1)
df.head()
```

Now that our column titles are in order, we can determine the relevance of all of them. Let’s say our analysis doesn’t need the `continent` column, so we can get rid of it to simplify our data. To delete columns, we can do so like this:

```{python}
df = df.drop(columns = {'continent'}, axis = 1)
df.head()
```

If we deleted the column by accident, you just have to go back and run the original line of code where we loaded the data set to start fresh and remove the changes.

Let’s take a look at the data types in our data frame.

```{python}
df.dtypes
```

Let’s say we want to change `Life_Expectancy` from a float (decimal value) to an integer.

```{python}
df['Life_Expectancy'] = df['Life_Expectancy'].astype(int)
df.dtypes
```

We could also convert multiple column types at once like this:

```{python}
df = df.astype({"Life_Expectancy": float, 
                "Population": float})
df.dtypes
```

If we wanted to count the number of unique values in a column, we could do so like this:

```{python}
df.Country.unique().size
```
