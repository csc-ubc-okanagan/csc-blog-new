# Using the Repo to Update the Blog

## Writing A Post

1. To build the blog locally, first open the cloned repository as a project in RStudio.

2. Run the `options(blogdown.method = "markdown")` command in your Console so that an `.md` file will be automatically generated from your `.RMD` file.

3. To create a new post on the blog, first create a new `.RMD` file in the `content/post` folder. The naming convention should begin with the date (YYY-MM-DD), followed by the article title. All spaces will be documented with a dash. For example, `2023-06-21-Intro-to-Python`.

4. The top section of the document should look like this example:
```
---
title:  "Dictionaries in Python" # update this title which will be viewable in the blog
author: ["Madison"] # update this accordingly
date: 2023-06-21 09:00:00 -0800 # update the date - the time isn't overly important
categories:  ["Python", "P_Getting Started"] # update these categories with the primary category first, sub category second
tags: ["python"] # tags always lowercase except for just 'R' as a tag
---
   ```
5. Begin writing the body of the post as a normal `.RMD` document with text, code chunks in R, Python, or both!

6. Once the post is completed, save the file.

7. Run `blogdown:::serve_site()` in your Console; this will build the blog locally and convert your `.RMD` file to a `.md` file.

Once this is done, commit the changes to the repo and the new blog version should be deployed.

## Categorizing Posts

The layout of the 'Categories' tab will follow this structure:

- Python
    - P_Getting Started
    - P_IDE
    - P_Data
    - P_Visualization
    - P_Modelling
    - P_Advanced
- R
    - R_Getting Started
    - R_IDE
    - R_Data
    - R_Visualization
    - R_Modelling
    - R_Advanced

All posts will fall into these categories, with Python and R as the primary categories, with identical subcategories. 

## Tagging Posts

The tags will be listed in all lowercase, with the exception of `R`. Multiple tags can be listed in each blog post.
