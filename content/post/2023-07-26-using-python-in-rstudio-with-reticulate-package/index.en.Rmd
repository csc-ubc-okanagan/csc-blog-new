As we know, Jupyter Notebook can be used easily with our UBC login information via [Syzygy](https://ubc.syzygy.ca/). Jupyter Notebook can also be downloaded to a computer and used via Anaconda. There are many different interfaces that allow us to use Python. One of the more interesting ones to note is actually RStudio. There is a package in R called *reticulate* that allows us to create an RMarkdown file and use both R and Python code chunks within the same file. This is actually how this blog is able to show both R and Python content! Let's get started on how *reticulate* is used in RStudio to include Python code.

## Installation

First, installation is required. To install the reticulate package in RStudio from CRAN, type the following:

```
install.packages("reticulate")
```

## Python Version

Next, we need to access the version of Python desired. Reticulate will, by default, find and use the version of Python via `PATH`. To check this, type `Sys.which("python")`.

If you would like to change the version to something other than what is found in `PATH`, try the `use_python()` function. Here is an example of how to call the package from the library, and then use a different path to get to the desired Python version.

```
library(reticulate)
use_python("/my/file/path/python")
```

# Getting Started

Now that the *reticulate* package has been installed, we can start using Python within an RMarkdown document.

Once an RMarkdown file has been started, create a new code block. Note that on a Windows, a shortcut for adding a new code block is Ctrl+alt+i. Once a new code block appears, it should look like this:

If you were to type code here, it would be in R. To change it to Python, simply replace the 'r' with 'python'. Then it will look like this:

Now, the console below will change to show Python code once something in this block is run. You can easily switch back and forth between R and Python from code chunk to code chunk. 

You can also see your saved variables in the environment, separated between R and Python. Note that when you do something such as import a dataset, if you wanted to perform manipulations on the dataset in both R and Python, you will have to load the dataset in using both R and Python, and it will create separate variables which do not override each other. They will stay speparate in the environment. 

To change between R and Python environments, go to the Environment window and click the dropdown arrow. It should look like this:

If you would like to see some examples, take a look at the `_src` folder in the GitHub repo for this blog to see how each of the posts are created in both R and Python. The link to the backend content for this blog can be found [here](https://github.com/csc-ubc-okanagan/R-Python-Blog).
