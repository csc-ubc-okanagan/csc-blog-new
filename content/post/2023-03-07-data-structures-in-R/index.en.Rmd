There are many different data structure types in `R`, each with varying levels of complexity and uses. The simplest data structure in `R` is a vector. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays (i.e., sets of values) of a single class (such as characters, numbers, dates, etc.), and they have a similar structure to the mathematical concept of vectors. For example, the vector $\vec v$ with values 1, 4, 6, 2 would be:

$$\vec v = \begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 4 \\ 6 \\ 2\end{bmatrix}.$$

In `R` we can create vectors using the `c()` function, as follows:

```{r}
v <- c(1, 4, 6, 2)
v
```

(`R` prints vectors in a line rather than as columns to improve readability.)

Since vectors can only contain elements of a common type, `c()` will force all elements to be of a single class. In the example below, I create a vector with the number 1, the letter "a", today's date, and the value `TRUE` (a boolean value), but `c()` coerces all values to be characters:

```{r}
c(1, 'a', Sys.Date(), TRUE)
```

If we place two vectors (of the same class) side by side, we can create a matrix. Matrices are thus two-dimensional arrays 


```{r}
# 2D arrays: matrices
matrix(data = 1:8, nrow = 2)
matrix(data = 1:8, ncol = 2)
matrix(data = 1:8, ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)

# matrix operations
matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)
matrix(1:9, ncol = 3) + 3
matrix(1:9, ncol = 3) * 2 # NOT matrix multiplication
matrix(1:9, ncol = 3) %*% 6:8 # matrix multiplication
matrix(1:9, ncol = 3) %*% matrix(1:6, ncol = 2)
```

If we want to create an object that has different data types, a matrix or vector won't work because `R` will force all items to be of the same type.

```{r}
class(c(0, 2))
class(c(0, 2, 'a')) # coerces all items to text
```

Instead, we need to use a list.

```{r}
# grouping objects with different and types: lists
l <- list(letters = c('a', 'b', 'c'),
          numbers = 1:10,
          today = Sys.Date())
l
l$letters
l$today
```

If we want a list that has a table-like structure (which will likely be the case for a lot of the data you use in `R`), we can use a data frame.

```{r, error=TRUE}
data.frame(num = 1:10,
           abc = LETTERS[1:10])
data.frame(num = 1:5,
           abc = LETTERS[1:10])
data.frame(num = 1:10,
           abc = LETTERS[1:9])
```

The tidyverse set of packages provides a "fancy data frame" that does not recycle elements (unless they are a single value), and allows you to reference other columns you previously created:

```{r, error=TRUE}
library('tibble')
tibble(num = 1:10,
       abc = LETTERS[num])
tibble(num = 1:5,
       abc = LETTERS[1:10])
```
