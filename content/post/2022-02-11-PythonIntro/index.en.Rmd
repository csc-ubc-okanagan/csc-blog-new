## Python can be used as a calculator

```{python}
1 + 1
```



```{python}
2-3
```



```{python}
6 / 2
```



```{python}
3 * 4
```



Since Python is so widely used, there are many people who contribute to continuously improving and developing it. Let's imagine Python as a base version. It can do basic calculations, but it requires extra efforts to do more complicated things. People have created extras or add-ons to help create shortcuts for more complicated specific tasks or functions. These 'add-ons' are called packages. Packages can be imported to use to help make things easier. For example, there is a Python package called math that helps with basic mathematical operations. Let's look at an example here of calling the package using the ```import``` command.

```{python}
import math
math.sqrt(9)
```

Once it has been imported, it does not need to be re-imported for the rest of this document. You can also import multiple packages within the same document. We will get into more useful packages later on!

```{python}
math.log(100)
```

For now, practice typing basic calculations into your Python terminal to get used to the syntax, and see how easy it is to calculate things!
