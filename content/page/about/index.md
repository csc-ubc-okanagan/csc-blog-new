This blog was created by UBC Okanagan's Centre for Scholarly Communication. It contains various blog posts to assist students with their pursuit of research utilizing tools such as R and Python.

For specific questions, the **Search** tab will allow you to search for specific topics or key words to help find a blog post relating to your question. For general learnings, the **Home** page lists all active posts, and the categories tab is useful to read current posts for each topic, such as general Python posts or Getting Started posts.

If you are starting from scratch and aren't sure whether to learn R or Python first, try visiting our [post](https://csc-ubc-okanagan.github.io/csc-data-blog/p/python-vs-r-how-to-decide/) outlining the pros and cons of each, as well as discipline norms.

The blog posts here were created by Research Data Consultants. If you find yourself with a question that has not been answered by the blog posts currently available, feel free to reach out to schedule a one-on-one consultation with us [here](https://csc.ok.ubc.ca/consultations/research-data-consultation/). If you have ideas for blog posts that would be beneficial to add, feel free to share them with us via email at [csc.ok@ubc.ca](mailto:csc.ok@ubc.ca).
